"""
Bet history for the picks dashboard: every bet the scheduled runs suggested,
graded against final scores.

Each run's picks are merged into the previous history.json (read back from
the `picks` branch). A bet is keyed by game, market and side and locked in
as first alerted; later runs don't change or remove it. Final scores come
from nflverse games.csv, so a bet is graded the first run after the score
is posted.
