"""
Bet history for the picks dashboard: every bet the scheduled runs suggested,
graded against final scores.

Each run's picks are merged into the previous history.json (read back from
the `picks` branch). A bet is keyed by game, market and side; a later run
before kickoff replaces it (the line or stake may have moved), and once the
game starts the last version stands. Final scores come from nflverse
games.csv, so a bet is graded the first run after the score is posted.
