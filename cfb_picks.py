"""
College football picks: the NFL model's pick engine (bviolino93/NFL-model picks.py)
pointed at college games. Runs on a schedule from .github/workflows/picks.yml,
separately from the Streamlit app (app.py).

    ODDS_API_KEY=... python cfb_picks.py --out site/index.html

Same steps as the NFL picks:
  1. every book's spreads and totals from The Odds API (us + eu)
  2. sharp-weighted, de-vigged fair lines (selector.consensus), with the
     result distributions built from college games (bigger margins, fewer
     key numbers than the NFL)
  3. cfb_model's prediction of result-minus-line moves the fair line:
     spreads, and totals capped to the best few a week (MAX_MODEL_TOTALS)
  4. every DraftKings/FanDuel offer priced; bets that clear the EV bar are
     sized (quarter Kelly) and explained in football terms

The bet history, alerts and dashboard work like the NFL model's
(bviolino93/NFL-model), published to GitHub Pages from the picks branch.
